    Overview

A mosquito-transmitted virus causes most cases of West Nile infection.
Most people infected with West Nile virus either don't develop signs or
symptoms or have only minor ones, such as fever and mild headache.
However, some people develop a life-threatening illness that includes
inflammation of the spinal cord or brain.

Mild signs and symptoms of a West Nile virus infection generally go away
on their own. But severe signs and symptoms — such as a severe headache,
fever, disorientation or sudden weakness — require immediate attention.

Exposure to mosquitoes where West Nile virus exists increases your risk
of getting infected. Protect yourself from mosquitoes by using mosquito
repellent and wearing clothing that covers your skin to reduce your risk.


    Symptoms

Most people infected with the West Nile virus have no signs or symptoms.


      Mild infection signs and symptoms

About 20 percent of people develop a mild infection called West Nile
fever. Common signs and symptoms include:

  * Fever
  * Headache
  * Body aches
  * Vomiting
  * Diarrhea
  * Fatigue
  * Skin rash


      Serious infection signs and symptoms

In less than 1 percent of infected people, the virus causes a serious
neurological infection, including inflammation of the brain
(encephalitis) and of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal
cord (meningitis).

Signs and symptoms of neurological infections include:

  * High fever
  * Severe headache
  * Stiff neck
  * Disorientation or confusion
  * Stupor or coma
  * Tremors or muscle jerking
  * Seizures
  * Partial paralysis or muscle weakness

Signs and symptoms of West Nile fever usually last a few days, but signs
and symptoms of encephalitis or meningitis can linger for weeks or
months. Certain neurological effects, such as muscle weakness, can be
permanent.


      When to see a doctor

Mild symptoms of West Nile fever usually resolve on their own. For signs
or symptoms of serious infection, such as severe headaches, a stiff
neck, disorientation or confusion, seek medical attention right away. A
serious infection generally requires hospitalization.

    Causes

  *
    West Nile virus transmission cycle
    <https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/36/ds00226_-ds00438_im00836_r7_westnileviruscyclethu_jpg.jpg>


          West Nile virus transmission cycle


          West Nile virus transmission cycle

    When a mosquito bites an infected bird, the virus enters the
    mosquito's bloodstream and eventually moves into its salivary
    glands. When an infected mosquito bites an animal or a human (host),
    the virus is passed into the host's bloodstream, where it may cause
    serious illness.

Typically, West Nile virus spreads to humans and animals via infected
mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds.
You can't get infected from casual contact with an infected person or
animal.

Most West Nile virus infections occur during warm weather, when
mosquitos are active. The incubation period — the period between when
you're bitten by an infected mosquito and the appearance of signs and
symptoms of the illness — ranges from two to 14 days.

West Nile virus has occurred in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle
East. It appeared in the United States in the summer of 1999, and since
then has been reported in every state except Hawaii and Alaska, as well
as in Canada.


      Other possible routes of transmission

In a few cases, West Nile virus might have spread through other routes,
including organ transplantation and blood transfusion. However, blood
donors are screened for the virus, substantially reducing the risk of
infection from blood transfusions.

There also have been reports of possible transmission of the virus from
mother to child during pregnancy or breast-feeding or exposure to the
virus in a lab, but these are rare and not conclusively confirmed.


    Risk factors

Most cases of West Nile virus in the United States occur June through
September. Cases have been reported in all 48 lower states.


      Risk of serious infection

Even if you're infected, your risk of developing a serious West Nile
virus-related illness is extremely small — less than 1 percent of people
who are infected become severely ill. And most people who do become sick
recover fully. You're more likely to develop a severe or fatal infection
based on:

  * *Age.* Being older puts you at higher risk.
  * *Certain medical conditions.* Certain diseases, such as cancer,
    diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease, increase your risk. So
    does receiving an organ transplant.


    Prevention

Your best bet for preventing West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne
illnesses is to avoid exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate standing
water, where mosquitoes breed.

  * Unclog roof gutters.
  * Empty unused swimming pools or empty standing water on pool covers.
  * Change water in birdbaths and pet bowls regularly.
  * Remove old tires or unused containers that might hold water and
    serve as a breeding place for mosquitoes.
  * Install or repair screens on windows and doors.

To reduce your exposure to mosquitoes:

  * Avoid unnecessary outdoor activity when mosquitoes are most
    prevalent, such as at dawn, dusk and early evening.
  * Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors.
  * Apply mosquito repellent containing an Environmental Protection
    Agency-registered insect repellent to your skin and clothing. Choose
    the concentration based on the hours of protection you need — the
    higher the percentage (concentration) of the active ingredient, the
    longer the repellent will work. Follow the directions on the
    package, paying special attention to recommendations for use on
    children.
  * When outside, cover your infant's stroller or playpen with mosquito
    netting.

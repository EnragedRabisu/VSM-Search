West Nile is a virus most commonly spread to people by mosquito bites.
In North America, cases of West Nile virus (WNV) occur during mosquito
season, which starts in the summer and continues through fall. WNV cases
have been reported in all of the continental United States. There are no
vaccines to prevent or medications to treat WNV. Fortunately, most
people infected with WNV do not have symptoms. About 1 in 5 people who
are infected develop a fever and other symptoms. About 1 out of 150
infected people develop a serious, sometimes fatal, illness. You can
reduce your risk of WNV by using insect repellant and wearing protective
clothing to prevent mosquito bites.

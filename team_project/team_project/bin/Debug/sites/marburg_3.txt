  * Marburg virus disease, related to Ebola, causes severe hemorrhagic
    fever
  * Hundreds may have been exposed to the virus, the WHO says

(CNN)An outbreak of contagious and deadly Marburg virus disease in the
Kween district of eastern Uganda was declared by the nation's Ministry
of Health <http://health.go.ug/press-release> on October 19.

Marburg virus disease, which causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever,
ranks among the most virulent pathogens
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/marburg/en/> known to infect humans,
according to the World Health Organization.
As of Saturday, two confirmed cases, one probable case and two suspected
cases have been reported in the Kween district, on the border with
Kenya, Tarik Jašarević, a spokesman for the WHO, wrote in an email. The
confirmed and probable cases -- two brothers and a sister -- have died.

The first case detected by the Ministry of Health was a 50-year-old
woman who died at a health center of fever, bleeding, vomiting and
diarrhea on October 11. One of the woman's brothers died of similar
symptoms three weeks earlier and was buried in a traditional ceremony. A
game hunter, the man lived near a cave inhabited by Rousettus bats,
which are natural hosts of the Marburg virus.
Laboratory tests at the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe
confirmed that Marburg was the cause of both deaths.

The WHO, which is working with Ugandan health authorities to contain the
outbreak, has followed up with 135 contacts of the patients, Jašarević
said. Some positive news has come of these investigations: Blood tests
showed no infection in two health care workers who had previously been
classified as suspected cases.
Still, several hundred people may have been exposed to the virus at
health facilities and at traditional burial ceremonies in the Kween
district, according to the WHO.

"Marburg is a virus that is in the same family as Ebola, and it
basically has very similar characteristics," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a
spokesman for the Infectious Disease Society of America. "So it spreads
in blood and body fluids and thrives in areas in which people are not
able to do effective infection control and take care of patients with
appropriate personal protection equipment."
Although direct contact with the blood, secretions or other bodily
fluids from infected people spreads the disease, touching contaminated
surfaces and materials (such as clothing or bedding) may also spread the
virus.


Symptoms and mortality rate

Once transmitted, the virus incubates for two to 21 days. High fever,
severe headache and extreme lethargy are the most prominent symptoms,
which may also include muscle aches, diarrhea, abdominal cramping,
nausea and vomiting. Hemorrhaging begins between five and seven days
after the fever starts. Fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding,
often from multiple areas.
Patients appear "ghost-like," with drawn features, deep-set eyes and
expressionless faces, according to the WHO.
On average, the mortality rate is about 50% for this hemorrhagic fever,
which was first detected in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks in
Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. During previous
outbreaks, though, fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% depending
on the viral strain and how well health authorities managed the disease,
according to the WHO.
Currently, there are no treatments for Marburg virus disease.
"The medical interventions are largely going to be supportive care --
very similar to Ebola," said Adalja, a board-certified infectious
disease physician. Fever control will be most important, he added, and
patients may be treated with intravenous fluids and, in more advanced
health care settings, electrolyte replacement.
"Those types of interventions were found to be very beneficial during
Ebola," Adalja said. Some of the experimental drugs that were tried
during the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa three years ago may have
some effect on this virus, he said, so "on the ground, you may see some
of the experimental antiviral therapies being used."
Vaccines are in development for both Marburg and Ebola, with most
attention given to Ebola, though some vaccines may be beneficial in
protecting against Marburg and the same family of viruses, Adalja said.
Beyond these medical obstacles, the WHO reported that it faces
challenges in the form of misinformation, superstition and suspicion
among residents in the areas at risk.


'Double-edged' situation

Kween district
<http://www.ubos.org/onlinefiles/uploads/ubos/2014CensusProfiles/KWEEN.pdf>,
a mountainous area 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northeast of
Kampala, boasts a total population of 93,667 people, according to the
Uganda Bureau of Statistics. About a third of the population is
illiterate, and just 4% of households have access to electricity. Over
90% of households grow crops, while more than 80% breed livestock.
Subsistence farming is the main source of livelihood for 84% of the
households.
Are we ready for the next global epidemic?

Many people in this rural district believe witchcraft
<http://www.afro.who.int/news/rumours-misinformation-and-negative-beliefs-underpin-current-marburg-outbreak-uganda>
is responsible for the deaths that have occurred in their community,
according to the WHO. The community members also do not hold health
systems and workers in high regard, with many suspecting that health
workers are deliberately killing some people to save others from the
mysterious disease.
"Convincing people to go to hospital is proving a daunting task for
community engagement responders," a WHO news bulletin
<http://www.afro.who.int/news/rumours-misinformation-and-negative-beliefs-underpin-current-marburg-outbreak-uganda>
says.
Jašarević noted, for example, one of the confirmed cases who traveled
into Kenya "in search of traditional healers."
The man, a Ugandan national, crossed into Kenya at the village of Bwayi.
There, medical personnel suspected that he might be suffering from the
hemorrhagic fever and placed him in quarantine in Trans-Nzoia County in
western Kenya as of Tuesday, health authorities confirmed. His samples
were taken to the Kenya Medical Research Institute for testing.
The villagers of Kween also search caves for bat droppings, which are
considered good manure for their crops.
Direct transmission from bats to humans is possible, yet the virus can
also "spill between bats and non-human primates, such as monkeys,
chimpanzees and gorillas, and from there it may be going into humans,"
Adalja said.
A few cases from animal exposure can get amplified by human transmission
and other factors, such as "non-ideal infection control procedures in
health care facilities," he added. "We know that burial practices, just
as we saw with Ebola, can foster the spread of this virus as well."
Burial practices, which include washing the deceased in preparation for
funerals, facilitate contact with bodily fluids.
The outbreak, though cause for concern, is far from hopeless.

"Although Marburg is a scary, deadly disease, it's not very contagious,"
Adalja said. If people are provided with protective equipment and they
change their burial practices, the outbreak can be contained and
extinguished.
"You have to remember that Uganda has dealt with Ebola and Marburg
outbreaks for several decades. They are usually very adept at dealing
with these," Adalja said. "It's not completely foreign the way Ebola was
in West Africa."
For the current outbreak, prevention and containment activities are
underway as health authorities continue to investigate family and
community contacts.
"Public health authorities are reaching out to people and giving them
actionable public health messages that they understand and can be
followed," Adalja said.
The situation in Uganda is "double-edged," he said. "The fact that this
outbreak is occurring in a rural area may make it harder to get
resources there, but it also makes it harder for the virus to spread."

  Ebola virus disease

Fact sheet
Updated June 2017

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      Key facts

  * Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic
    fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.
  * The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in
    the human population through human-to-human transmission.
  * The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality
    rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.
  * The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central
    Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West
    Africa involved major urban areas as well as rural ones.
  * Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks.
    Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions,
    namely case management, infection prevention and control practices,
    surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe
    burials and social mobilisation.
  * Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment
    improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to
    neutralize the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug
    therapies are under development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      Background

The Ebola virus causes an acute, serious illness which is often fatal if
untreated. Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in 2
simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now, Nzara, South Sudan, and the
other in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter occurred in a
village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.

The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex
Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were
more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also
spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land
borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The virus family Filoviridae includes three genera: Cuevavirus,
Marburgvirus, and Ebolavirus. Within the genus Ebolavirus, five species
have been identified: Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Reston and Taï Forest.
The first three, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, and Sudan
ebolavirus have been associated with large outbreaks in Africa. The
virus causing the 2014–2016 West African outbreak belongs to the Zaire
ebolavirus species.


      Transmission

It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural
Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through
close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids
of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys,
forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.

Ebola then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct
contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood,
secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with
surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these
fluids.

Health-care workers have frequently been infected while treating
patients with suspected or confirmed EVD. This has occurred through
close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not
strictly practiced.

Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the
deceased can also contribute in the transmission of Ebola.

People remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus.


      Sexual transmission

More surveillance data and research are needed on the risks of sexual
transmission, and particularly on the prevalence of viable and
transmissible virus in semen over time. In the interim, and based on
present evidence, WHO recommends that:

  * All Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should receive
    counselling to ensure safe sexual practices until their semen has
    twice tested negative. Survivors should be provided with condoms.
  * Male Ebola survivors should be offered semen testing at 3 months
    after onset of disease, and then, for those who test positive, every
    month thereafter until their semen tests negative for virus twice by
    RT-PCR, with an interval of one week between tests.
  * Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should either:
      o abstain from all types of sex, or
      o observe safe sex through correct and consistent condom use until
        their semen has twice tested negative.
  * Having tested negative, survivors can safely resume normal sexual
    practices without fear of Ebola virus transmission.
  * Based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by
    the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO
    recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe
    sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their
    semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus.
  * Until such time as their semen has twice tested negative for Ebola,
    survivors should practice good hand and personal hygiene by
    immediately and thoroughly washing with soap and water after any
    physical contact with semen, including after masturbation. During
    this period used condoms should be handled safely, and safely
    disposed of, so as to prevent contact with seminal fluids.
  * All survivors, their partners and families should be shown respect,
    dignity and compassion.

  * For more, read the Guidance on clinical care for survivors of Ebola
    virus disease
    <http://www.who.int/entity/csr/resources/publications/ebola/guidance-survivors/en/index.html>



      Symptoms of Ebola virus disease

The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with
the virus to onset of symptoms is 2 to 21 days. Humans are not
infectious until they develop symptoms. First symptoms are the sudden
onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is
followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and
liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding
(e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). Laboratory findings
include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver
enzymes.


      Persistent virus in people recovering from Ebola virus disease

Ebola virus is known to persist in immune-privileged sites in some
people who have recovered from Ebola virus disease. These sites include
the testicles, the inside of the eye, and the central nervous system. In
women who have been infected /while/ pregnant, the virus persists in the
placenta, amniotic fluid and fetus. In women who have been infected
/while/ breastfeeding, the virus may persist in breast milk.

Studies of viral persistence indicate that in a small percentage of
survivors, some body fluids may test positive on reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Ebola virus for longer than 9 months.

Relapse-symptomatic illness in someone who has recovered from EVD due to
increased replication of the virus in a specific site is a rare event,
but has been documented. Reasons for this phenomenon are not yet fully
understood.


      Diagnosis

It can be difficult to clinically distinguish EVD from other infectious
diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation
that symptoms are caused by Ebola virus infection are made using the
following diagnostic methods:

  * antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
  * antigen-capture detection tests
  * serum neutralization test
  * reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
  * electron microscopy
  * virus isolation by cell culture.

Careful consideration should be given to the selection of diagnostic
tests, which take into account technical specifications, disease
incidence and prevalence, and social and medical implications of test
results. It is strongly recommended that diagnostic tests, which have
undergone an independent and international evaluation, be considered for
use.

  * Diagnostic tests evaluated through the WHO Emergency Use Assessment
    and Listing process
    <http://www.who.int/entity/medicines/ebola-treatment/emp_ebola_diagnostics/en/index.html>


Current WHO recommended tests include:

  * Automated or semi-automated nucleic acid tests (NAT) for routine
    diagnostic management.
  * Rapid antigen detection tests for use in remote settings where NATs
    are not readily available. These tests are recommended for screening
    purposes as part of surveillance activities, however reactive tests
    should be confirmed with NATs.

The preferred specimens for diagnosis include:

  * Whole blood collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) from
    live patients exhibiting symptoms.
  * Oral fluid specimen stored in universal transport medium collected
    from deceased patients or when blood collection is not possible.

Samples collected from patients are an extreme biohazard risk;
laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under
maximum biological containment conditions. All biological specimens
should be packaged using the triple packaging system when transported
nationally and internationally.


      Treatment and vaccines

Supportive care-rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids- and
treatment of specific symptoms, improves survival. There is as yet no
proven treatment available for EVD. However, a range of potential
treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies
are currently being evaluated.

An experimental Ebola vaccine proved highly protective against the
deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV,
was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people during 2015. Among the
5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10
days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10
days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.

The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health,
Médecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health,
in collaboration with other international partners. A ring vaccination
protocol was chosen for the trial, where some of the rings are
vaccinated shortly after a case is detected, and other rings are
vaccinated after a delay of 3 weeks.


      Prevention and control

Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions,
namely case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good
laboratory service, safe burials and social mobilisation. Community
engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising
awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures
(including vaccination) that individuals can take is an effective way to
reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on
several factors:

  * *Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission* from contact
    with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of
    their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other
    appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat)
    should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.
  * *Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission* from direct or
    close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with
    their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective
    equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home.
    Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in
    hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.
  * *Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission,* based on
    further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO
    Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends
    that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and
    hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen
    tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids
    should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended.
    WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent
    patients whose blood has been tested negative for Ebola virus.
  * *Outbreak containment measures,* including prompt and safe burial of
    the dead, identifying people who may have been in contact with
    someone infected with Ebola and monitoring their health for 21 days,
    the importance of separating the healthy from the sick to prevent
    further spread, and the importance of good hygiene and maintaining a
    clean environment.


      Controlling infection in health-care settings:

Health-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring
for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include
basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective
equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials),
safe injection practices and safe burial practices.

Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed
Ebola virus should apply extra infection control measures to prevent
contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and contaminated
surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close
contact (within 1 metre) of patients with EBV, health-care workers
should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and
goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile
gloves for some procedures).

Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and
animals for investigation of Ebola infection should be handled by
trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.


      WHO response

WHO aims to prevent Ebola outbreaks by maintaining surveillance for
Ebola virus disease and supporting at-risk countries to developed
preparedness plans. The document provides overall guidance for control
of Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks:

  * Ebola and Marburg virus disease epidemics: preparedness, alert,
    control, and evaluation
    <http://www.who.int/entity/csr/resources/publications/ebola/manual_EVD/en/index.html>


When an outbreak is detected WHO responds by supporting surveillance,
community engagement, case management, laboratory services, contact
tracing, infection control, logistical support and training and
assistance with safe burial practices.

WHO has developed detailed advice on Ebola infection prevention and control:

  * Infection prevention and control guidance for care of patients with
    suspected or confirmed Filovirus haemorrhagic fever in health-care
    settings, with focus on Ebola
    <http://www.who.int/entity/csr/resources/publications/ebola/filovirus_infection_control/en/index.html>

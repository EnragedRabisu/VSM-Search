  * Marburg virus disease is endemic in Africa (likely in African green
    monkeys and certain bats) and can be transmitted to humans.
  * The disease can be transmitted from person to person by exposure to
    blood and other bodily secretions.
  * Marburg virus disease is caused by viruses
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm>
    that produce symptoms of fever
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm>, chills
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm>, headaches
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm> and muscle aches
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm> early in
    the disease; symptoms worsen and may lead to hemorrhagic fever
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm> and death.
  * Risk factors include exposure to African green monkeys and certain
    bats; in addition, exposure to an infected human is high risk factor.
  * The diagnosis of Marburg virus disease is usually done by
    specialized laboratories.
  * Treatment is limited to supportive care, usually in an
    intensive-care unit.
  * Specialists that may be consulted include critical-care specialists,
    infectious-disease specialists, hematologists, lung specialists, and
    others.
  * Prevention of Marburg viral disease involves avoiding contact with
    African animals that may carry the disease and using strict
    isolation procedures to avoid any bodily fluids or tissues from
    humans infected with Marburg viruses.
  * The prognosis for Marburg virus disease is only fair to poor;
    fatality rates vary from about 23%-90%.
  * Complications of Marburg virus infections include eye, nerve, and
    bleeding problems.
  * Research is ongoing; Africa is experiencing more problems with viral
    diseases as humans increase their contact with African animals that
    previously had little contact with humans.

      What is Marburg virus disease?

In 1967, laboratory workers, all in the same lab in Marburg, Germany,
were hospitalized with an unknown disease. The laboratory workers were
exhibiting the same symptoms, including fever, diarrhea
<https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm>, vomiting
<https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm>, massive
bleeding from many different organs, shock
<https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm>, and collapse of the
circulatory system. In this outbreak, 31 people were infected, and seven
died. The source of the infection was traced to a virus infecting
African green monkeys that were imported from Uganda, Africa, and were
being used for polio
<https://www.medicinenet.com/polio_facts/article.htm> vaccine research.
This new virus was eventually designated as a new virus family termed
/Filoviridae/. The other members of the family are Ebola
<https://www.medicinenet.com/ebola_hemorrhagic_fever_ebola_hf/article.htm>
viruses (five different species). /Filoviridae/ contain one
negative-sense RNA strand and have a covering or envelope composed of a
lipid
<https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_levels_pictures_slideshow/article.htm>
membrane. The disease Marburg virus causes is termed Marburg virus disease.

The most recent outbreaks of Marburg virus disease have occurred in
Uganda. In 2012, 15 individuals were diagnosed and four people died (27%
fatality rate). Again, the Ugandan Ministry of Health reported on Oct.
5, 2014, that a health-care worker died of Marburg virus disease
(formerly known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever [Marburg HF]) on Sept. 30,
2014. The source of his exposure is not clear. This is of interest since
Marburg virus is a close relative of the Ebola virus
<https://www.medicinenet.com/ebola_hemorrhagic_fever_ebola_hf/article.htm>,
and both produce clinical signs and symptoms that are often
indistinguishable. Health officials said that about 80 people who were
in contact with the man who died have been identified and are being were
observed for 21 days for signs and symptoms of the disease. No one else
contracted the disease.

      What causes Marburg disease?

Marburg and Ebola viruses are considered to be zoonotic infections
(transmitted to humans from life cycles in other animals). Although it
is unclear as to which animals contain both Marburg and Ebola, it is
thought that both may be transmitted to humans from monkeys and/or bats
(African fruit bat and /Rousettus/ bat). There is no evidence for any
insect vectors. Although it is unclear how humans contract these viruses
from other animals (perhaps by eating them or by contamination of animal
body fluids), it is clear that human-to-human transfer occurs by direct
contact with an infected person's bodily fluids (for example, saliva,
tears, excretions, vomitus, and blood). The Marburg viruses are not
thought to be spread by air droplets.

      What are the *symptoms* and signs of Marburg infection? What is
      the incubation period for a Marburg virus infection?

  * Share Your Story
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/submit-patient-comments.asp?questionid=5282>


The symptoms of Marburg virus infection usually come on suddenly after
an incubation period of about five to 10 days. Early symptoms are as
follows:

  * Fever
  * Chills
  * Headache <https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm>
  * Muscle aches

About five days after the symptoms first occur, other symptoms may occur
as follows:

  * A rash <https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm> occurs on the
    chest, back, and stomach in some individuals.
  * Nausea <https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm>
  * Vomiting <https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm>
  * Chest pain <https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm>
  * Sore throat
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm>
  * Abdominal pain
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm>
  * Diarrhea
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm>
    may appear.

Symptoms continue and can become severe; they include the following:

  * Jaundice
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm>
  * Pancreatic inflammation
  * Severe weight loss <https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm>
  * Delirium <https://www.medicinenet.com/delirium/symptoms.htm>
  * Liver
    <https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm>
    failure
  * Massive hemorrhaging with organ dysfunction

The case fatality rate (death rate
<https://www.medicinenet.com/grief_bereavement_mourning_quiz/quiz.htm>)
ranges from about 23%-90% of infected individuals. Many of the symptoms
are similar to those of other infectious diseases such as Ebola, malaria
<https://www.medicinenet.com/malaria_facts/article.htm>, typhoid fever
<https://www.medicinenet.com/typhoid_fever/article.htm>, and others; so
diagnostic tests are useful to rule out other causes of the symptoms.
People exposed to Marburg virus usually show signs of infection no later
than about 14 days after exposure, but because the clinical symptoms
resemble Ebola virus
<https://www.medicinenet.com/ebola_virus_pictures_slideshow/article.htm>
disease, most people are placed in isolation for 21 days.

      What are risk factors for getting Marburg infections?

People at risk are those who come in contact with African monkeys (bush
meat means meat from monkeys) and bats; individuals who do research on
these viruses are also at higher risk of becoming infected. There have
been several outbreaks in Africa in miners due to their exposure to
bats. Veterinarians may also be at higher risk if they are exposed to
African monkeys. Also, people who care for Marburg virus-infected
patients and/or health workers who remove those bodies of deceased
Marburg virus-infected patients are at high risk of contracting the disease.

*

*


      How do health-care professionals diagnose Marburg viral infections?

The diagnosis is usually not made from clinical findings; however,
during outbreaks, clinical findings should trigger health-care
professionals to isolate patients who may have symptoms of Marburg virus
infection. There are laboratory tests including polymerase chain
reaction
<https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm>
(PCR
<https://www.medicinenet.com/pcr_polymerase_chain_reaction/article.htm>)
and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA
<https://www.medicinenet.com/elisa_tests/article.htm>) that can detect
the Marburg virus later in the course of the disease. These help
distinguish Marburg viruses from others that cause Ebola and Lassa fever
<https://www.medicinenet.com/lassa_fever/article.htm>.

Like Ebola and many other viral diseases, there is no specific treatment
for Marburg virus disease. Patients are given supportive hospital care
by maintaining their fluid and electrolyte balance and other
considerations, such as replacing lost blood and maintaining a good
oxygen supply. This supportive care is most effectively done in an
intensive-care hospital unit. There are no home remedies to treat
Marburg virus infections.

*

      What specialists treat Marburg infections?

Most individuals with Marburg virus infections are treated in hospitals
in the intensive-care units. Specialists who treat the patient are
critical-care specialists, hematologists, infectious-disease
specialists, hospitalists, and lung specialists.

      Is it possible to prevent Marburg virus infections?

There is no antiviral drug or vaccine approved for use in humans against
Marburg viruses. Preventive measures are based on barrier techniques
(isolation techniques) that isolate the infected patient from other
humans. Those health-care professionals who treat Marburg virus-infected
patients must use barrier protections such as gowns, gloves, masks, and
shoe coverings; most experts say the best barrier is a hazmat suit and a
well-informed person who knows how to decontaminate a hazmat suit.

*

*


      What is the prognosis for a Marburg virus infection? What
      complications may occur with Marburg infections?

The prognosis for Marburg infection ranges from fair to poor. The
fatality rate varies from about 23%-90%. Individuals cared for in an
intensive-care unit have a better chance of survival. Complications that
can occur with Marburg infection include the following:

  * Retinitis (inflammation of the retinas of the eyes)
  * Orchitis (inflammation of the testes)
  * Hepatitis <https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm>
    (liver inflammation)
  * Uveitis <https://www.medicinenet.com/uveitis/article.htm>
    (inflammation within he pigmented layer of the eye)
  * Transverse myelitis (inflammation of a segment of the spinal cord)
  * Encephalitis (brain inflammation)

*

*


      What research is ongoing about Marburg virus infections?

Research about these viruses is ongoing. Sarepta Therapeutics has been
developing the RNA-interfering drug termed AVI-7288. This drug is
targeted against the nucleocapsid protein of the virus, and the company
has reported infection protection in monkeys ranging from 83%-100% when
given four days after the monkeys were infected with Ebola. This drug is
undergoing a phase 1 safety trial that began in May 2014. Another
company, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals from British Columbia, has a lipid
nanoparticle that interferes with the RNA replication of this virus. It
too has shown protection against Marburg virus infection in monkeys.
This drug is termed TKM-Marburg (also termed NP-718m-LNP).

*

*


      Why is Africa now seeing so many cases of what were relatively
      rare viral diseases like Ebola and Marburg virus infections?

There are several main reasons that researchers postulate for an increase:

  * Destruction of habitats of monkeys and bats bring humans into close
    contact with those animals that harbor these viruses in the wild.
  * Poor economies have left many African people destitute so that some
    of them hunt, kill, and eat wild animals like monkeys (bush meat).
  * Even in countries with poor economies, a few major cities have
    hospitals and those individuals who are sick are brought in from
    isolated villages and, if not diagnosed and isolated, spread the
    disease inadvertently to other humans.

Africa has undergone the worst outbreak of hemorrhagic fever caused by
Ebola virus that it has ever seen (2014-2015, with about 28,610
suspected and/or confirmed infections and 11,380 deaths). For the first
time, patients had become infected outside of Africa. It is
disconcerting that yet another hemorrhagic fever caused by Marburg virus
may enter this potentially lethal arena.

            Abdominal Pain (Causes, Remedies, Treatment)

    Abdominal pain can have many causes that range from mild to severe.
    Some of these causes include bloating, gas, colitis, endometriosis,
    food poisoning, GERD, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), ovarian cysts,
    abdominal adhesions, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
    colitis, gallbladder disease, liver disease, and cancers.

    Signs and symptoms of the more serious causes include dehydration,
    bloody or black tarry stools, severe abdominal pain, pain with no
    urination or painful urination.

    Treatment for abdominal pain depends upon the cause.

    Although a fever technically is any body temperature above the
    normal of 98.6 F (37 C), in practice, a person is usually not
    considered to have a significant fever until the temperature is
    above 100.4 F (38 C). Fever is part of the body's own
    disease-fighting arsenal; rising body temperatures apparently are
    capable of killing off many disease-producing organisms.

      o viral infections,
      o toxins,
      o irritants,
      o trauma, or
      o injury to the throat area.
    Common symptoms of a sore throat include a fever, cough, runny nose,
    hoarseness, earaches, sneezing, and body aches. Home remedies for a
    sore throat include warm soothing liquids and throat lozenges. OTC
    remedies for a sore throat include OTC pain relievers such as
    ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Antibiotics may be necessary for some
    cases of sore throat.

Ebola Virus Ecology and
Transmission(https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/resources/virus-ecology.html)
<https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/resources/virus-ecology.html>

Ebola, previously known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly
disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus species. Ebola
can cause disease in humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas,
and chimpanzees).

Ebola is caused by infection with a virus of the family
/Filoviridae/(https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/virus-families/filoviridae.html)
<https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/virus-families/filoviridae.html>, genus
/Ebolavirus/. There are five identified Ebola virus species, four of
which are known to cause disease in humans: Ebola virus (/Zaire
ebolavirus/); Sudan virus (/Sudan ebolavirus/); Taï Forest virus (/Taï
Forest ebolavirus/, formerly /Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus/); and Bundibugyo
virus (/Bundibugyo ebolavirus/). The fifth, Reston virus (/Reston
ebolavirus/), has caused disease in nonhuman primates, but not in humans.

Ebola viruses are found in several African countries. Ebola was first
discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. Since then, outbreaks have appeared sporadically
in Africa.

The natural reservoir host of Ebola virus remains unknown. However, on
the basis of evidence and the nature of similar viruses, researchers
believe that the virus is animal-borne and that bats are the most likely
reservoir. Four of the five virus strains occur in an animal host native
to Africa.

People get Ebola through direct contact (through broken skin or mucous
membranes in, for example, the eyes, nose, or mouth) with

  * blood or body fluids (including but not limited to urine, saliva,
    sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen) of a person who is sick
    with or has died from Ebola,
  * objects (like needles and syringes) that have been contaminated with
    body fluids from a person who is sick with Ebola or the body of a
    person who has died from Ebola,
  * infected fruit bats or primates (apes and monkeys), and
  * possibly from contact with semen from a man who has recovered from
    Ebola (for example, by having oral, vaginal, or anal sex)
